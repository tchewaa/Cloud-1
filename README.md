# Cloud-1
The purpose of this project was to demostrate to the student's knowledge in cloud infrustracture by hosting a wordress website either using AWS Cloud services, Google Cloud Services or Microsoft Azure Cloud Services.

Elastic Beanstalk Architecture was used to create the web environment for the project.  With Elastic Beanstalk you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications.  In addition, for data manangement RDS service was used which made it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups.  On top of that Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) was used, this was mainly for storing images on the AWS platform.

# Expectations
- Website on 2 instances.
- Load Balacing to ease traffic.
- Static content distribution (CDN).
- Sessions on both instances.
- New content appears on both instance without any failures.
- Schema explanation of the infrastructure.
# Important Note
Due to the fact that the AWS service selected for the project was a FreeTier, the website could only run for a week.
